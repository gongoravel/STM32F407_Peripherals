# STM32F407_Peripherals
This folder contains the main code of some projects developed in Keil for the STM32F4-Discovery board. Each subfolder corresponds to a different project where different peripherals of the STM32F407 MCU are being explored. Some of the projects were intended to use external sensors like the HMC5883L, the ESP8266 module or the LIS3DSH accelerometer. Unfortunately, some of these projects were developed long ago and I have updated them, however, I think it would be a good resource in order to explore firmware development through the configuration of the registers from scratch. In some cases different versions of the projects are being posted to compare the configuration of the MCU using the registers and the HAL library.

Finally, if you have any questions or comments do not hesitate to contact me, I will be happy to help. I am not an expert but I have some experience using the STM32 MCUs especially by developing the code configuring the registers from scratch.

Thank you for your attention and I hope my code helps. Happy hacking!
